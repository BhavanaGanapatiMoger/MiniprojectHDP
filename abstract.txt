-Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early prediction and prevention critical. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques for heart disease prediction, using a dataset of 65,000 records with various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. Several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were evaluated to determine the most effective model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease.
